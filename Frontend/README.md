## 🛠️ Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Local web server (optional but recommended)

### Running Locally

#### Option 1: Using Python's Built-in Server
```bash
# Navigate to the Frontend directory
cd Frontend

# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

#### Option 2: Using Node.js http-server
```bash
# Install http-server globally (one-time)
npm install -g http-server

# Navigate to the Frontend directory
cd Frontend

# Start the server
http-server -p 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

#### Option 3: Using VS Code Live Server
1. Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code
2. Right-click on `index.html`
3. Select "Open with Live Server"

### Backend Configuration

The frontend connects to the Spring Boot backend API. Update the API endpoint in `JS/script.js` if needed:

```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:8080/api';
```

## 🌐 Deployment

### Deploying to Vercel / Render

1. **Install Vercel CLI** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Navigate to Frontend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Frontend
   ```

3. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

4. **Follow the prompts**:
   - Set up and deploy: Yes
   - Which scope: Select your account
   - Link to existing project: No
   - Project name: crowdshield-frontend (or your preferred name)
   - Directory: ./
   - Override settings: No

5. **Production Deployment**:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

### Deployment Configuration

Create a `vercel.json` file in the Frontend directory for custom configuration:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "**/*",
      "use": "@vercel/static"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/$1"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Environment Variables

For production deployment, update the API endpoint in your code or use environment-specific configuration:

```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = process.env.API_URL || 'https://your-backend-api.com/api';
```
